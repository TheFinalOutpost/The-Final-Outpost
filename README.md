# The Final Outpost API

## Applying for access

You can send a request to admin@finaloutpost.net.  Please include your TFO username, the reason you want to access the API, the name of your site, and the IP address of your site.

## General Requirements

You will receive the URL needed to call the API along with your private key.

All methods must be sent using POST. For security reasons, API calls are only valid from HTTPS domains.

The API should only be used to ping once. Please store the individual creature data on your server and don’t ping the site for every page load. Make sure when you display the image on your site that you use the URL provided by the API (https://finaloutpost.net/s/creatureCode.png). /rimg/ and /r/ are dynamic urls for internal use only while as /s/ is a image cache file that will will much faster for you and use less resources for me

## Sending a request

You need to send two variables in addition to your key.

 - **Action**
	 - lab
		 -  Used to both validate a user and to return the user's growing creatures.
	 - creature
		 -  Used to both validate a creature as well as view information about it.
	 - multipleCreatures

 - **Var**
	 -  If using the lab call, username expected.
	 - If using the creature calls either a code or a list of codes expcted. See individual calls for more info.
